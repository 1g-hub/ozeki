abstract = {In this paper, we present a new software framework developed in Pyomo, MindtPy (Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Decomposition Toolbox for Pyomo), which implements several decomposition methods for solving Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programs (MINLP). These methods decompose the MINLP into a Mixed-integer Linear Program (MILP) and a Nonlinear Program (NLP). The methods implemented in this toolbox are designed to find the global optimal solution of convex MINLP problems. This toolbox allows the user to specify certain algorithmic options for these methods, which were not available in a single solver. Using Process Systems Engineering appications; the computational implementation and performance are discussed.}

abstract = {An outer-approximation algorithm is presented for solving mixed-integer nonlinear programming problems of a particular class. Linearity of the integer (or discrete) variables, and convexity of the nonlinear functions involving continuous variables are the main features in the underlying mathematical structure. Based on principles of decomposition, outer-approximation and relaxation, the proposed algorithm effectively exploits the structure of the problems, and consists of solving an alternating finite sequence of nonlinear programming subproblems and relaxed versions of a mixed-integer linear master program. Convergence and optimality properties of the algorithm are presented, as well as a general discussion on its implementation. Numerical results are reported for several example problems to illustrate the potential of the proposed algorithm for programs in the class addressed in this paper. Finally, a theoretical comparison with generalized Benders decomposition is presented on the lower bounds predicted by the relaxed master programs.},

abstract = {An extended version of Kelley's cutting plane method is introduced in the present paper. The extended method can be applied for the solution of convex MINLP (mixed-integer non-linear programming) problems, while Kelley's cutting plane method was originally introduced for the solution of convex NLP (non-linear programming) problems only. The method is suitable for solving large convex MINLP problems with a moderate degree of nonlinearity. The convergence properties of the method are given in the present paper and an example is provided to illustrate the numerical procedure.}
